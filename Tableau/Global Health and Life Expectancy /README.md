# Global Health & Life Expectancy Analysis – Tableau

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard explores patterns in global health indicators, focusing on life expectancy and its relationship with BMI and blood pressure across countries. The analysis emphasises visual interpretation, comparative exploration, and pattern identification.

---

## Objectives

- Compare life expectancy across countries  
- Examine BMI distribution patterns  
- Analyse BMI and blood pressure relationships  
- Identify visible trends and anomalies

## Dashboard Components

### Life Expectancy by Country

**Purpose**  
Visualise variation in life expectancy across countries.

**Insight**  
Life expectancy values vary noticeably between countries, indicating differences in health outcomes and broader socioeconomic conditions.

---

### BMI Distribution

**Purpose**  
Understand the spread and concentration of BMI values.

**Insight**  
Most observations cluster within moderate BMI ranges, with limited extreme values.

---

### BMI vs Blood Pressure

**Purpose**  
Explore potential relationships between body metrics and cardiovascular indicators.

**Insight**  
Blood pressure values show moderate variation, with no dominant linear pattern relative to BMI.
