# Industry & Regional Change Analysis – Tableau

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard explores distribution and variation patterns across industries and regions, focusing on category differences, geographic clustering, and comparative change behaviour.

---

## Objectives

- Compare values across industries  
- Analyse regional distribution patterns  
- Identify variation and concentration effects  
- Demonstrate categorical and geographic analysis  

---

## Dashboard Components

### Regional Distribution (Map)

**Purpose**  
To visualise how data points are distributed across regions.

**Insight**  
The visualisation highlights geographic clustering, suggesting that values are concentrated in specific regions rather than evenly distributed.

---

### Industry Change Comparison

**Purpose**  
To evaluate variation and differences between industries.

**Insight**  
Variation differs across categories, with some industries showing stronger change patterns than others.

---

## Key Observations

- Regional clustering patterns are visible  
- Distribution is uneven across industries  
- Variation differs between categories  
- No single category dominates the dataset  
- Visual analysis supports comparative interpretation
